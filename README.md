# Alfred Maestro ([Download][dl])

#### Activate any of your Keyboard Maestro macros in Alfred

This is a workflow for anyone who uses Keyboard Maestro and wishes it had built-in Alfred support. In Alfred simply type `km` followed by the name of any of your KM macros.



## Requirements

Alfred 3 with Powerpack and Keyboard Maestro 6.3 or greater.
If you don't have them, go get them immediately.
You will not regret it.

- [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) (Free, but requires £17 Powerpack)
- [Keyboard Maestro](http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/) (Free to try. $36/license)

Both well worth the cost.



## Installation

[Download the file directly][dl], then double-click _Alfred Maestro.alfredworkflow_ file to install.

[dl]: https://github.com/iansinnott/alfred-maestro/releases/download/0.2.2/AlfredMaestro.alfredworkflow

### Installing from sources
You can also compile and install this workflow from sources.
It's written in [Go](https://golang.org/), so you should install it first.

1. Clone this repository
2. Install [AwGo library](https://github.com/deanishe/awgo): `go get github.com/deanishe/awgo`
3. Run `make pack`
4. Double-click _Alfred Maestro.alfredworkflow_ file to install the workflow.




## Usage

Type `km` followed by the name of any of your defined macros.
Use <kbd>⌘</kbd> modifier to reveal the macro in Keyboard Maestro.

I also wrote a blog post on how I personally use this workflow for anyone who's interested: [Integrating Alfred and Keyboard Maestro][blogpost]

#### Update:

Thanks to Peter Lewis of [Stairways Software][stair], the creator of Keyboard Maestro for adding a feature to KM that greatly increased the power of this workflow. Now Alfred can launch any of your macros, not just the ones with a hotkey!

## Possible Issues

### Application Specific Macro Groups

**Important:** If you have macros that you only want to run in certain applications read this.

If you create a macro group that is _not_ set to run in all applications you will need to make sure it is set to run in Alfred in addition to whatever application you want it to run in. See [issue 5][issue5] for details.

### _Unable to get macros from Keyboard Maestro_
If you're using macOS Mojave and get the following error, it's very likely that Alfred doesn't have access to Keyboard Maestro. First, make sure that [Alfred has all needed access to your system](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/getting-started/macos-mojave/#integration). Then check that [Alfred could access Keyboard Maestro](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/923973/52786326-4213cc00-3063-11e9-85d0-1b58c0ce03ae.png). If after that Alfred still doesn't show you your macros ping us in [#22](https://github.com/iansinnott/alfred-maestro/issues/22) and we'll try to help you.
